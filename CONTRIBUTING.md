# Contributing to Dendrite

Everyone is welcome to contribute to Dendrite! We aim to make it as easy as
possible to get started.

Please ensure that you sign off your contributions! See [Sign Off](#sign-off)
section below.

## Getting up and running

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for instructions on setting up a running dev
instance of dendrite, and [CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md) for the code style
guide.

We use `gb` for managing our dependencies, so `gb build` and `gb test` is how
to build dendrite and run the unit tests respectively.


## Picking Things To Do

If you're new then feel free to pick up an issue labelled [easy](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/labels/easy).
These should be well-contained, small pieces of work that can be picked up to
help you get familiar with the code base.

Once you're comfortable with hacking on Dendrite there are issues lablled as
[help-wanted](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/labels/help-wanted), these
are often slightly larger or more complicated pieces of work but are hopefully
nonetheless fairly well-contained.

We ask people who are familiar with Dendrite to leave the [easy](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/labels/easy)
issues so that there is always a way for new people to come and get involved.
